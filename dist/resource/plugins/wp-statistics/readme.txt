== Installation ==
1. Upload `wp-statistics` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Make sure the Date and Time is set correctly in WordPress.
4. Go to the plugin settings page and configure as required (note this will also download the GeoIP database for the fist time).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What do I do if the plugin does not work? =
Disable then enable the plugin.  You may also want to try removing and re-installing it as well.  If it is still not working, please open a new support thread on the [WordPress support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-statistics).

= All visitors are being set to unknown for their location? =
Make sure you've downloaded the GeoIP database and the GeoIP code is enabled.

Also, if your running an internal test site with non-routable IP addresses (like 192.168.x.x or 172.28.x.x or 10.x.x.x), these addresses will come up as unknown always unless you have defined a location in the "Country code for private IP addresses" setting.

= GeoIP is enabled but no hits are being counted? =
The GeoIP code requires several things to function, PHP 5.3 or above, the cURL extension and PHP cannot be running in safe mode.  All of these conditions are checked for but there may be additional items required.  Check your PHP log files and see if there are any fatal errors listed.

= How much memory does PHP Statistics require? =
This depends on how many hits your site gets.  The data collection code is very light weight, however the reporting and statistics code can take a lot of memory to process.  The longer you collect data for the more memory you will need to process it.  At a bare minimum, a basic WordPress site with WP Statistics should have at least 32 meg of RAM available for a page load.  Sites with lots of plugins and high traffic should look at significantly increasing that (128 to 256 meg is not unreasonable).

= I've enabled IP subnet exclusions and now no visitors are recorded? =
Be very careful to set the subnet mask correctly on the subnet list, it is very easy to catch too much traffic.  Likewise if you are excluding a single IP address make sure to include a subnet mask of 32 or 255.255.255.255 otherwise you may not get the expected results.

= I'm not receiving e-mail reports? =
Make sure you have WordPress configured correctly for SMTP and also check your WP Cron is working correctly.  You can use [Cron View](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cron-view) to examine your WP Cron table and see if there are any issues.

= Does WP Statistics support multi-site? =
WP Statistics doesn't officially support multi-site however it does have limited functionally associated with it and should function without issue.  However no support is provided at this time.

Version 8.8 is the first release that should install, upgrade and remove correctly on mutli-site as well as have some very basic support for the network admin menu.  This should not be taken as an indication that WP Statistics fully supports multi-site, but only as a very preliminary first step.

= Does WP Statistics track the time of the hits? =
No.

= I'm using another statistics plugin/service and get different numbers for them, why? =

Pretty much every plugin/service is going to give you different results for visits and visitors, there are several reasons for this:

* Web crawler detection
* Detection method (javascript vs server side PHP)
* Centralized exclusions

Services that use centralized databases, like Google Analytics, for spam and robot detection have better detection than WP Statistics can.  The trade off of course is relaying on an external service.

= The search words and search engine referrals are zero or very low, what's wrong? =

Search Engine Referrals and Words are highly dependent on the search engine providing the information to us and that often is not the case.  Unfortunately there is nothing we can do about this, we report on everything we receive.

= Why did my visits suddenly jump way up today? =

There can be many reasons for this, but the most common reason is a botnet has decided to visit your site and we have been unable to filter it out.  You usually see your visits spike for a few days and then they give up.

= What’s the difference between Visits and Visitors? =

Visits is the number of page hits your site has received.

Visitors is the number of unique users that have visited your site.

Visits should always be greater than Visitors (though there are a few times when this won’t be true on very low usage sites due to how the exclusion code works).

The average number of pages a visitor views on your site is Visits/Visitors.

= My overview screen is blank, what's wrong? =

This is usually caused by a PHP fatal error, check the page source and PHP logs.

The most common fatal error is an out of memory error. Check the Statistics->Optimization page and see how much memory is currently assigned to PHP.

If it is a memory issue you have two choices:
 - Increase PHP's memory allocation
 - Delete some of your historical data.

See https://php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.memory-limit for information about PHP's memory limit.

To remove historical data you can use the Statistics->Optimization->Purging->Purge records older than.

= Not all referrals are showing up in the search words list, why? =

Unfortunate we're completely dependent on the search engine sending use the search parameters as part of the referrer header, which they do not always do.

= Does WP Statistics work with caching plugins? =

Probably not, most caching plugins don't execute the standard WordPress loop for a page it has already cached (by design of course) which means the WP Statistics code never runs for that page.

This means WP Statistics can't record the page hit or visitor information, which defeats the purpose of WP Statistics.

We do not recommend using a caching plugin along with WP Statistics.

= PHP 7 Support =

WP Statistics is PHP 7 compliant, however some versions of PHP 7 have bugs that can cause issues.  One know issue is with PHP 7.0.4 causing memory exhaustion errors, newer versions of PHP 7 do not have this issue.

At this time (August 2016) WP Statistics seems to run fine with PHP 7.0.10, however you may experience issues that we haven't found yet.  If you do, feel free to report it after you've confirmed it is not a problem with PHP.

= PHP 7.1 Support =

WP Statistics has not yet been tested on PHP 7.1 and reports so far (As of February 2017) indicate there are issues.  As PHP 7.1 is still relatively new it is not recommended at this time.

= IPv6 Support =

WP Statistics supports IPv6 as of version 11.0, however PHP must be compiled with IPv6 support enabled, otherwise you may see warnings when a visitor from an IPv6 address hits your site.

You can check if IPv6 support is enabled in PHP by visiting the "Optimization->Resources/Information->Version Info->PHP IPv6 Enabled" section.

If IPv6 is not enabled, you may see an warning like:

	Warning: inet_pton() [function.inet-pton]: Unrecognized address 2003:0006:1507:5d71:6114:d8bd:80c2:1090

= GDPR Support =

The greatest advantage of WP Statistics is, that all the data is saved locally in WordPress.

This helps a lot while implementing the new GDPR restrictions because it’s not necessary to create a data processing contract with an external company!

Introduction of a popup with “Accept” and “Deny” before collection data and Hash IP addresses is a useful option on the WP-Statistics.

* Fixed: Order of parameters in referrers page when viewing individual referrers was incorrect and resulted in a blank list.
* Fixed: UpdatedSQL for last post date detection to order by post_date instead of ID as someone could enter a date in the past for their publish date.  Thanks PC1271 for the fix.
* Fixed: The referrers widget would only select the first 100k records due to a limit in PHP/MySQL, it will now select all records.
* Removed: Widget selection and ordering from the settings page, the "Screen Options" tab can now be used on the enabled/disable widgets and drag and drop will remember their location.
* Removed: Overview page memory usage in the optimization page as it is no longer relevant.
